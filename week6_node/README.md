## Node & Express

### Node

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment. It allows developers to use
JavaScript to write server-side code, which means that they can create web applications with JavaScript on both the
client and server-side.

1. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to write server-side code using JavaScript.
2. Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used by Google Chrome.
3. Node.js is lightweight and efficient, which makes it a popular choice for building scalable and high-performance applications.
4. Node.js has a large and active community of developers, which means that there are many resources and libraries available to help you build your application.
5. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means that it can handle many requests at the same time without blocking the main thread.
6. Node.js supports a wide range of modules and packages, which makes it easy to add new functionality to your application.
7. Node.js can be used for a wide range of applications, including web servers, chat applications, real-time collaboration tools, and more.

Overall, Node.js is a powerful and flexible tool that allows developers to write server-side code using JavaScript.
It's a great option for building scalable and high-performance applications, and it's supported by a large and active
community of developers.

### Express

Express is a popular web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications.
It provides a range of tools and features that make it easy to create server-side applications using Node.js.

1. Express is a web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications.
2. Express provides a range of tools and features that make it easy to create server-side applications using Node.js.
3. Express uses middleware, which allows developers to add functionality to their applications without having to write a lot of code.
4. Express supports a range of template engines, which makes it easy to generate dynamic HTML pages.
5. Express includes built-in support for routing, which allows developers to define how different URLs should be handled by their applications.
6. Express supports a wide range of HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more.

### Exercises

Before we start with `express` we're going to use Node.js to create a simple server. Express is built on top of Node.js, 
so it's important to understand how Node.js works before we start using Express. 

**Remember to read the** [Node.js Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/) before you start. 
**Reading the documentation is an important part of learning how to use a new tool!**


#### 1. Create a simple Node.js server

// To be implemented


#### 2. Create a simple Express server
