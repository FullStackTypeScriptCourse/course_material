## Hand-in and Exam.
1. Create a GitHub repo for all your work in this course and link to it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IKFYbYwqUlZ0sUaFcLaxl154NgoaRl0g57yY6k3ipo0/edit?usp=sharing)
2. The repo should contain a folder for each week. Each folder should contain a README.md file with the answers to the exercises.
3. There should also be a folder for the semester project which you will work on gradually over the course.
4. All your code in the repo will be used for the exam.
