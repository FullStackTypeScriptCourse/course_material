## Hand-in and Exam.
1. Create a GitHub repo for all your work in this course and link to it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IKFYbYwqUlZ0sUaFcLaxl154NgoaRl0g57yY6k3ipo0/edit?usp=sharing)
2. The repo should contain a folder for each week. Each folder should contain a README.md file with the answers to the exercises.
3. There should also be a folder for the semester project which you will work on gradually over the course.
4. All your code in the repo will be used for the exam.

## Semester project requirements
- The project should be a fullstack typescript project with a frontend and a backend.
- The project should be deployed to a server.
- The project should use a mongodb database.
- The project should use graphql for communication between frontend and backend.

### Optional requirements
- The project could be deployed on a docker container on Digital Ocean.
- The project could use a CI/CD pipeline for deployment.
- The project could use a frontend library for routing (react router, etc.)
- The project could use a frontend library for styling (styled components, material ui, etc.)
- The project could expose som rest endpoints alongside the graphql endpoint.
- The project could use JWT for authentication and some of the endpoints could be protected.

## Exam details
- The exam is primaryly based on your group semester project.
- The exam is a 30 min **individual** oral exam with no preparation time based on your code (primaryly the semester project)
- You will be asked to explain and/or extend your code
- You will be asked questions about the course curriculum
