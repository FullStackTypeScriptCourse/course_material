## Important !!

The class on the 09/03 will take place on Thursdays. It's going to be a workshop that takes place in room 3.12.
For Bornholm students, the lektion will take place another time on Bornholm. Date and time will be announced later.

## Hand-in and Exam.
1. Create a GitHub repo for all your work in this course and link to it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IKFYbYwqUlZ0sUaFcLaxl154NgoaRl0g57yY6k3ipo0/edit?usp=sharing)
2. The repo should contain a folder for each week. Each folder should contain a README.md file with the answers to the exercises.
3. There should also be a folder for the semester project which you will work on gradually over the course.
4. All your code in the repo will be used for the exam.
