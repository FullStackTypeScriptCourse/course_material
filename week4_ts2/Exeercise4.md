# Week 4 Exercise: Typescript in React
## Part 1
1. Take a simple react project from last semester and convert it to typescript.
2. Start out without the strict mode and then add it in later.
3. Use the steps in this [guide](https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-migrate-a-react-app-to-typescript/) to add types to your project.

## Part 2
1. Create a new project with `npm init vite@latest my-react-ts-app -- --template react-ts`
2. Create a small web application using react and typescript to display a list of people. The application should have the following features:
  - A list of people with their name, age, and occupation
  - A button that adds a new person to the list
  - A button that removes the last person from the list
  - A button that sorts the list by age
  - A form to add a new person to the list
  - A form to update a persons details
3. Use a json-server to store the data. You can use the following command to start the server:
  - `npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001`

#### Upload your solutions to github
1. Create a new folder on your github repo called `week4_ts`
2. Both part 1 and 2 of the exercise should be available as a full project in the `week4_ts` folder.
3. Remember to add a README.md file to the project with instructions on how to run the project.
