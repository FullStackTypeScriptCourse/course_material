# Class exercises about Hooks and state management in React
1. Take an old project with multiple components and make a copy of it.
2. Refactor the project to use Preact signals instead of React hooks.
3. Put a console.log in each component to see how the components are re-rendered when the state changes.
4. Use the effect function to see how it only runs when the state changes.
