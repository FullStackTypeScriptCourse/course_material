# React hook Exercises
## useReducer
- Create a simple counter app using useReducer.
  - The app should have a counter and two buttons to increment and decrement the counter.
  - The counter should not go below 0.
  - The counter should have a incrementer button and a decrementer button.
  - When the counter is 0 the decrementer button should be disabled.
  - the reducer should be in a separate file.

## Custom hooks
- Make your own useAuth hook to handle login and logout.
  - The hook should return the user object and a login and logout function.
  - The user object should be stored in the context.
  - The user object should be available to all components in the app.
