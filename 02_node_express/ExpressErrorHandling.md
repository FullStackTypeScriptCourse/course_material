### Express Error Handling
- you need tou have completed the `Express Basic Basic` and `Express Routes` Exercise before you can start this part.

- Error handling in Express is done through the use of middleware. The error-handling middleware is defined with four arguments: (err, req, res, next). For example:

```js
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
    console.error(err.stack)
    res.status(500).send('Something broke!')
})
```
- The error-handling middleware always takes four arguments. You must provide four arguments to identify it as an error-handling middleware function. Even if you donâ€™t need to use the next object, you must specify it to maintain the signature. Otherwise, the next object will be interpreted as regular middleware and will fail to handle errors.

- If you define multiple error-handling middleware functions, they are executed sequentially, just like regular middleware functions. The first error-handling middleware function that calls next() will transfer control to the next error-handling middleware function. If no error-handling middleware function calls next(), the default Express error handler will be invoked, which simply returns an Internal Server Error (500) status code to the client.
