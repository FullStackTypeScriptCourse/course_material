# Week 5: Semester project part 1: React and Typescript

## Objectives
- Deepen your understanding of typescript and react
- Create the first part of your semester project
- Get more routine working with the different react ojbect types
- Do the first part of the project to hand in for the exam.

## What we are building for the exam project
- We are creating a web app, so in your group discuss what the app should do.
- The backend and frontend will communicate using a REST API with JSON data.
- The frontend will be a single page application (SPA) that uses React and Typescript.
- The backend will be a REST API that uses Node.js and Express.
- The backend will store data in a MongoDB database.

## Part 1: Planning your project
1. Discuss what your app should do.
2. Create a list of the different entities that your app will use.
3. Create a list of the different endpoints that your app will use.
4. Design the json data that will be used to communicate between the frontend and backend.
5. Create a list of the different components that your app will use.
6. Setup a json-server to provide the proper json endpoints for your app.

## Part 2: Create the frontend
1. Create a new React project using Vite by running the following command:
`npm create vite@latest my-project --template react-ts`
2. Use Figma to design the frontend for your app.
3. Create the components that you need for your app.






## Hand in
Hand in before next class session by uploading your solution to github and fill out this google [form](https://forms.gle/Yzhcp7raAw3d2J53A) with your details.
The github repo must contain the following:
1. README.md file in project root describing your project.
2. A folder called `src` containing all your source code.
3. All the necessary files and folders created by vite to install and run the project.
