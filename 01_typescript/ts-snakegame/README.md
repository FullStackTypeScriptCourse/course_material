# Snake Game

## Context and Objectives

This is a simple snake game made with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

The goal of this exercise is to convert the JavaScript code to TypeScript.
Rename the `snake.js` file to `snake.ts` and fix all the errors.

- add types to all the variables
- add types to all the functions
- add types to all the function parameters
- add types to all the function return values
- add types to all event listeners and Html elements
- add types to all classes (and their properties and methods) 
- remember to add `public/private` modifiers to the properties and methods of the classes
- in some cases you will need to use the `!` operator to tell TypeScript that a variable is not null or undefined

Before you need to initialize TypeScript in your project:

```bash
  npm install typescript --save-dev # if you not already have it
  npx tsc --init
```

Have fun! üêç
