# TypeScript

## What is TypeScript?

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript
- TypeScript is a statically typed language (JavaScript is dynamically typed)
- TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript
- TypeScript is developed and maintained by Microsoft
- TypeScript is open source

## Why TypeScript?

- Static Typing: TypeScript provides static typing, allowing you to catch errors during development rather than at runtime. This can lead to more robust and maintainable code.
- Object-Oriented Programming: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features such as classes, interfaces, and inheritance.
- Code Readability: With type annotations, the code becomes more self-documenting. It enhances the readability of the code, making it easier for developers to understand and work with.
- Code Intelligence: TypeScript integrates with development tools, providing better code intelligence, autocompletion, and refactoring support. This can significantly improve the development experience, especially in large projects.
- Easier Collaboration: Type definitions serve as documentation for functions and objects, making collaboration easier. Other developers can understand the expected types and use them correctly.


## What is the difference between static and dynamic typing?

- Static typing: The type of a variable is known at compile time. The compiler can detect type errors during compilation.
- Dynamic typing: The type of a variable is known at runtime. Type errors can only be detected during runtime.


**Statically Typed Language:**

* Variable types are explicitly declared at compile-time.
* Type checking is performed at compile-time.
* Errors related to type mismatches are caught during compilation.
* Generally, requires more explicit type annotations.

**Dynamically Typed Language:**

* Variable types are determined at runtime.
* Type checking is performed at runtime.
* Errors related to type mismatches may only be discovered during program execution.
* Typically, allows more flexibility but may lead to runtime errors.
