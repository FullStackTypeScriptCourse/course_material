# Week 1: Javascript recap with callbacks

## Objectives

- Understand how to use callbacks
- Understand lambda functions
- Understand how to write functions that take functions as arguments
  - in a useful way
- Understand the most common used  features of ES6 

## How to prepare before class

1. See video on [callbacks: **6.43**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz_vwAF4NHI&ab_channel=JamesQQuick)
2. See video on [eventloop: **7.19**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqLSNG_79lI&ab_channel=JamesQQuick)

### What is a callback?

A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function. The function that takes the callback is called the "higher order function". The callback is called by the higher order function.
A callback function in JavaScript is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some kind of event or operation has completed. The function that takes the callback
function as an argument is often referred to as the "parent" function, and the callback function is often referred to as the "child" function.

### Why use callbacks?

Callbacks are useful when you want to do something asynchronously. For example, you might want to make an HTTP request to a server, but you don't want to wait for the response before continuing with your program. You can pass a callback to the function that makes the HTTP request, and the callback will be called when the response is received.

Callbacks are useful for when you want to do something after a long-running operation. For example, you might want to write a function that reads a file from disk, but you don't want to wait for the file to be read before continuing with your program. You can pass a callback to the function that reads the file, and the callback will be called when the file has been read.

Callbacks are also useful to configure how a function behaves. For example, you might want to write a function that filters an array in a certain way based on some specific criteria. These criteria can be passed as a callback to the function that filters the array as is the case with the array.filter() method in javascript.

## Class Exercise 1

Look at the following javascript code: 
```js 
  const readline = require('readline').createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
  });
  
  function greeting(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    readline.close();
  }
  
  function processUserInput(callback) {
    readline.question(`What's your name? `, callback);
  }
  
  processUserInput(greeting);
````
1. Look at the code above and try to explain what the code does. (apart from the first 4 lines)
2. Run the processUserInput function with a different callback (use lambda here) to console.log the name in uppercase.
3. Run the processUserInput function with a different callback (use lambda here) to console.log the length of the name

## Class Exercise 2

Look at the following javascript code: 
```js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

function operateOnNumbers(operator, x, y) {
  return operator(x, y);
}

console.log(operateOnNumbers(add, 3, 4));   // 7
console.log(operateOnNumbers(multiply, 3, 4));   // 12
````
1. Look at the code above and try to explain what the code does.
2. Run the operateOnNumbers function with a different operator (use lambda here) to subtract the numbers.
3. Based on above code example write a function that takes two functions and an array of numbers, and returns an array with the result of applying each function to each number in the array. E.g. lift to the power of 2 and then divide by 10 or something like that.

### How to use callbacks

Callbacks are functions, so they can be passed as arguments to other functions. For example, the setTimeout function takes a callback as an argument. The callback will be called after the specified amount of time has passed.

```js
console.log("Hello you");
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Hello again");
}, 1000);
```

### Lambda functions

Lambda functions are functions that are defined without a name. They are also called anonymous functions. Lambda functions are useful when you want to pass a function as an argument to another function. 

### How to write functions that take functions as arguments

```js
function doSomething(callback) {
  console.log("Doing something");
  callback();
}

doSomething(() => {
  console.log("Callback called");
});
```
